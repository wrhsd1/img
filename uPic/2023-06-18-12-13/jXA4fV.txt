The complexity of diabetes and diabetic wound healing remains a therapeutic chal- lenge because proper and systematic wound care and management are essential to prevent chronic microbial infection and mechanical damage to the skin. Marantodes pumilum, locally known as ‘Ka- cip Fatimah’, is an herb that has been previously reported to possess anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antinociceptive and antipyretic properties. The current study aims to assess the antioxidant and fibroblast cell migration activities of the fractions eluded from the dichloromethane extract of M. pumilum leaves. (2) The total antioxidant capacity of M. pumilum was assessed using the total pro- anthocyanidins and phosphomolybdenum assays, while DPPH, nitric oxide, hydrogen peroxide and superoxide free radical scavenging assays were tested to determine the antioxidant potential of M. pumilum. An in vitro scratch wound assay was performed to measure the fibroblast cell migration rate using normal and insulin-resistant human dermal fibroblast cells. (3) All M. pumilum fractions exhibited good antioxidant and fibroblast cell migration activity, among which fractions A and E displayed the greatest effect. (4) M. pumilum’s fibroblast migration activity could be attributed to its strong antioxidant properties along with its previously reported properties.
